# TEDIT 8.0 ENGLISH Version for ETS 1.33

> Attention!
TEDIT is intended for advanced users only.
If you do not know the next points ...
elementary structure of the game
the possibilities and limitations of the game
what is the "mod"
what is the "def", "defs of chassis/wheels/cargoes" and where to find them
what is the savegame and where to seek it
... then you have nothing to do in TEDIT! Delete TEDIT and forget about it!

### WHAT YOU NEED TO BUY OLD TRAILERS:
ANY purchased trailer MUST have at least the def, defined in the mod in the folder def\vehicle\trailer_defs\! Otherwise there will be a crash when trying to assign a garage to the trailer! Samples of some trailers can be found in the Mods folder.
The trailer is bought also, as before it was done in TEDIT - by clicking the button "Buy trailer". In the "Buy trailer" dialog in the "Trailer definition" field, it is NECESSARY to specify the trailer def - exactly the same as in mod!
For example, for a tipper trailer (owned_s_ki_solid.zip), open the file def\vehicle\trailer_defs\s_ki_solid.sii and at the top we see the full name of its def: "trailer_def.s_ki_solid" - that's exactly what it needs (without the quotes).
Having bought a trailer, save the savegame and load it in the game.
Go to the Trailer Manager, select the trailer bought through TEDIT and assign a garage (the Relocate button). That's all.
It is better not to enter the trailer configuration - there is nothing to do, besides, when selecting the "Paint" tab, there will be a game crash.

### Description:
This is not a mod. This is a program for easy editing of savegame in terms of your own trailer.
- You can buy or sell your own trailer (as many as you want).
- You can load and unload a cargo (or multiply cargoes) in/from your own trailer.
- You can repair your trailer.
- You can use dispatcher service to find a suitable for your trailer cargoes.
- You can completely change in-game logistics (by specifiyng IN and OUT cargoes for each company).
- You can easy add new companies on the map.
- You can set payment time (not immediately after unload but after a while).
- You can rewind the game time if you need.
and so on...

This version supports multiply trailers (doubles, triples, etc.). How to build, load and unload them - see in video "Multiply trailers - build, load, unload.mp4". When you load a cargo into the trailer the mass of a cargo is distributed equally between trailer and its dolly (parent trailer), but only if parent trailer have no jobs! 

Now each cargo have COG coefficients (cog.txt file). If program detects a missing cargo COG then used COG (0, 0.4444, 0) by default. You can change COG for each cargo manually in the program (in "Bases cargoes" dialog). 

Now in "Hotkeys config" dialog the codes of the keys represented as key names instead as numeric codes.
Now it is possible to cancel selected job by pressing [Delete] key in the job list.
Now take into account prices from trailers.txt file when you Sell a trailer.
The tools was updated.
